        "The only thing wrong with me was that I thought there was something wrong with me.",
        "I'm not going to panic because I don't do that anymore. It's going to be okay.",

        "Drag is dangerous. Drag is not politically correct, I know people say, ‘Oh, you mainstreamed it,' drag will never be mainstream....the deeper level of drag is all about you're born naked, and the rest is a drag.",
        "To win at life and to win in this competition, you have to be willing to die a thousand deaths and be reborn a thousand times.",
        "Success is something between you and yourself. I think only you know where you’ve come from and how far you wanna go.",
        "It’s true in everything, not just in drag: To be a success, you have to understand the landscape. You have to know thyself, and you have to know your history so that you can draw from people who have figured out the equation you are faced with. It’s not rocket science.",
        "Sure, my childhood was unusual. All these eccentric, wild people frequented our home: rock stars, drag queens, models, bikers, freaks. But I was not this little rich girl. My mom and I lived in an apartment.",

        "...the truth is, we are all basically the universe—pretending to be humans for a brief moment of time.’",
        "Now some people might think it doesn’t require a lot of work to look flawless on the runway. Well, think again.",
        "You went too fast. I thought you were running from the cops. You’ve probably run from the cops, haven’t you Vanjie?",
